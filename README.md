- I don't use Linux
- Pineapple goes on pizza
- JavaScript is a fun language
- It's pronounced /ɡɪf/ and not /dʒɪf/
- I have no idea where, to put commas,
- There are probalbly a lot of gramattical mistakes
- I'm from Czechia, and no, it's not called Czechoslovakia
- I'm actually not a cat as might my profile picture suggest
- Most of the colors that I use are plagiarized straight from the [Tailwind color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#default-color-palette)
